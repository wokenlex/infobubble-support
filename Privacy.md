# InfoBubble Privacy Policy


### 1. Your Data is Stored Locally

All of your data, including your workspaces, sources, criteria, and fetched news results, is stored in a single `.json` project file **on your computer**. You choose where to save this file, and it is never transmitted to us or any third party. We do not have access to your content.

### 2. News Fetching

To function, the app must connect to the internet to download content from the **Sources (RSS feeds and websites) that you specify**. This is limited to fetching data from the URLs you provide in your workspaces.

### 3. AI Data Processing

Newsmaker uses Artificial Intelligence to analyze, filter, and summarize news. You have full control over how this is done:

#### a) Apple Intelligence

*   If you enable the "Use Apple Intelligence" option, all AI-related processing (analysis, summarization, translation) happens **on your device**.
*   Your news content and criteria are processed by the macOS private AI framework and are **never sent to an external server**. This is the most private option.

#### b) External AI Services (OpenAI-Compatible)

*   If you choose to configure an external AI service, the app will send the following data to the server URL **you provide**:
    *   The text content of news articles.
    *   Your criteria prompts.
*   This data is sent to perform analysis, generate summaries, and provide translations.
*   **You are responsible for the privacy policy of the third-party AI service you configure.** This could be a commercial service like OpenAI or your own private, locally-hosted model.

### 4. Text-to-Speech (TTS)

The "read summary" feature uses the built-in macOS Text-to-Speech engine. The summary text is processed by your operating system to generate audio and is not sent to an external service by our application.

### 5. In-App Purchases

*   The one-time purchase to unlock the full version is handled securely by **Apple's App Store**.
*   We do not collect, process, or have access to any of your payment information.

### 6. Analytics and Tracking

**InfoBubble collects no analytics or usage data.** We do not use any third-party tracking tools. We do not know who you are or how you use the app.
